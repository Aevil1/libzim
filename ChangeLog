libzim 3.3.0
============

 * Fix handling of big cluster (>4GiB) on 32 bits architecture. This is mainly
 done by :
   * Do not mmap the whole cluster by default.
   * MMap only the memory asociated to an article.
   * If an article is > 4GiB, the blob associated to it is invalid
     (data==size==0).
   * Other information are still valid (directAccessInformation, ...)
 * Fix writing of extended cluster in writer.
 * Compile libzim on macos.
 * Build libzim setting RPATH.
 * Search result urls are now what is stored in the zim file. They should not
   start with a `/`. This is a revert of the change made in last release.
   (See kiwix/kiwix-lib#123)
 * Spelling corrections in README.

libzim 3.2.0
============

 * Support geo query if the xapian database has indexed localisation.
 * Handle articles bigger than 4Go in the zim file (#110).
 * Use AND operator between search term.
 * Fix compilation with recent clang (#95).
 * Add method to get article's data localisation in the zim file.
 * Be able to get only a part of article (#77).
 * Do not crash if we cannot open the xapian Database for some reasons.
   (kiwix/kiwix-tools#153)
 * Do not assumen there is always a checksum in the zim file.
   (kiwix/kiwix-tools#150)
 * Try to do some sanity checks when opening a zim file.
 * Use pytest to do some tests (when cython is available).
 * Use levenshtein distance to sort and have better suggestion results.
 * Search result urls are now always absolute (starts with a '/').
   (kiwix/kiwix-lib#110)
 * Open the file readonly when checking the zim file (and so be able to check
   read only file).
 * Accept absolute url starting with '/' when searching for article.
 * Fix various bugs

libzim 3.1.0
============

 * Lzma is not a optional dependency anymore.
 * Better handle (report and not crash) invalid zim file.
 * Embed source of gtest (used only if gtest is not available on the system)
 * Move zimDump tools out of libzim repository to zim-tools
 * ZimCreator tools doesn't not read command line to set options.

libzim 3.0.0
============

This is a major change of the libzim.
Expect a lot new improvement and API changes.

 * Add a suggestion mode to the search
 * Fix licensing issues
 * Fix wrong stemming of the query when searching
 * Deactivate searching (and so crash) in the embedded database if the zim is
   splitted
 * Rewrite the low level memory management of libzim when reading a zim file:
    * We use a buffer base entity to handle memory and reading file instead of
      reading file using stream.
    * MMap the memory when posible to avoid memory copy.
    * Use const when posible (API break)
 * Move to googletest instead of cxxtools for unit-tests.
 * Fix endiannes bug on arm.
 * Do not install private headers. Those headers declare private structure and
   should not be visible (API break)
 * Compile libzim with `-Werror` and `-Wall` options.
 * Make libzim thread safe for reading article.
   The search part is not thread safe, and all search operation must be
   protected by a lock.
 * Add method to get only a part of a article.
 * Move some tools to zim-tools repository.


libzim 2.0.0
============

 * Move to meson build system
   `libzim` now use `meson` as build system instead of `autotools`
 * Move to C++11Â standard.
 * Fulltext search in zim file.
   We have integrated the xapian fulltext search in libzim.
   So now, libzim provide an API to search in a zim containing embeded fulltext
   index. This means that :
    *libzim need xapian as (optional) dependencies (if you want compile with
     xapian support).
    * The old and unused search API has been removed.
 * Remove bzip2 support.
 * Remove Symbian support.
 * Few API hanges
   * Make some header files private (not installed);
   * A `Blob` can now be cast to a `string` directly;
   * Change a lot of `File` methods to const methods.

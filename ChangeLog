libzim 2.0.0
============

 * Move to meson build system
   `libzim` now use `meson` as build system instead of `autotools`
 * Move to C++11Â standard.
 * Fulltext search in zim file.
   We have integrated the xapian fulltext search in libzim.
   So now, libzim provide an API to search in a zim containing embeded fulltext
   index. This means that :
    *libzim need xapian as (optional) dependencies (if you want compile with
     xapian support).
    * The old and unused search API has been removed.
 * Remove bzip2 support.
 * Remove Symbian support.
 * Few API hanges
   * Make some header files private (not installed);
   * A `Blob` can now be cast to a `string` directly;
   * Change a lot of `File` methods to const methods.
